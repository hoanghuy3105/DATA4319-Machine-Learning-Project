Statistical & Machine Learning (DATA 4319) is a senior level data science course blends the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition as well as the algorithmic perspectives of machine learning taught at the University of Houston-Downtown.

The course consists of 10 machine learning projects that implemented in Python and Julia.

### Supervised Machine Learning

In Supervised learning, we train the machine using data which is well "labeled." It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning Data science model takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, Data scientist must rebuild models to make sure the insights given remains true until its data changes.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning deep learning and reinforcement learning methods.

### Acknowledgement
I would like to thank you Dr. Davila for his helpfully informative lectures during entire Spring 2021 semester.
